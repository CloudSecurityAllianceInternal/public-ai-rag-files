10.1.7 The Rise and Role of DevOps
DevOps refers to the deeper integration of development and operations teams through better
collaboration and communications, with a heavy focus on automating application deployment and
infrastructure operations. There are multiple definitions, but the overall idea consists of a culture,
philosophy, processes, and tools.
At the core is the combination of Continuous Integration and/or Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) through
automated deployment pipelines, and the use of programmatic automation tools to better manage
infrastructure. DevOps is not exclusive to cloud, but as discussed it is highly attuned to cloud and is
growing to become the dominant cloud application delivery model.

10.1.7.1 Security Implications and Advantages
• Standardization: With DevOps, anything that goes into production is created by the CI/CD
pipeline on approved code and configuration templates. Dev/Test/Prod are all based on the
exact same source files, which eliminates any deviation from known-good standards.
• Automated testing: As discussed, a wide variety of security testing can be integrated into the CI/
CD pipeline, with manual testing added as needed to supplement.
• Immutable: CI/CD pipelines can produce master images for virtual machines, containers, and
infrastructure stacks very quickly and reliably. This enables automated deployments and
immutable infrastructure.
• Improved auditing and change management: CI/CD pipelines can track everything, down to
individual character changes in source files that are tied to the person submitting the change,
with the entire history of the application stack (including infrastructure) stored in a version
control repository. This offers considerable audit and change-tracking benefits.
• SecDevOps/DevSecOps and Rugged DevOps: These two terms are emerging to describe the
integration of security activities into DevOps. SecDevOps/DevSecOps sometimes refers to the
use of DevOps automation techniques to improve security operations. Rugged DevOps refers
to integration of security testing into the application development process to produce harder,
more secure, and more resilient applications.
